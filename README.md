PHPGeoExtensions
================

A PHP estension to add some fast algorithm for spatial clustering, partitioning and shape grouping (i.e. convex hull, minimum circle, k-means clustering, etc)

**WARNING**
The kmlocal subdirectory is the 1.7.2 version of kmlocal from: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/Projects/KMeans/

I renamed kmlocal-1.7.2 directory to kmlocal to overcome some parsing issues in config.m4 (filename is defined as the first token before the first point)
